Today is the beginning of our salvation \\
and the manifestation of the mystery \\
    \cont which is from eternity. \\
The Son of God becomes the Son of the Virgin, \\
and Gabriel announces grace. \\
So with him let us also cry to the Mother of God: \\
Rejoice, thou who art full of grace! \\
The Lord is with thee.

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 8}
Queen of the Heavenly Host, Defender of our souls, \\
we thy servants offer to thee songs of \\
    \cont victory and thanksgiving, \\
for thou, O Mother of God, hast delivered us \\
  \cont from dangers. \\
\vskip-1.7em
But as thou hast invincible power, \\
free us from conflicts of all kinds that we \\
   \cont may cry to thee: \\
\vskip-1.7em
Rejoice, unwedded Bride!

\subheader{Magnification}

The Archangel's cry we sing to thee, O Pure One, \\
Hail, thou who art full of grace, \\
the Lord is with thee.
