By raising Lazarus from the dead before \\
        \cont Thy passion, \\
Thou didst confirm the universal resurrection, \\
        \cont O Christ God! \\
Like the children with the branches of victory, \\
we cry out to Thee, O Vanquisher of Death: \\
Hosanna in the highest! \\
Blessed is he that comes in the name
   \cont of the Lord!

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 6}
Sitting on Thy throne in heaven, \\
and carried on a foal on earth, O Christ God, \\
accept the praise of angels \\
and the songs of children who sing: \\
Blessed is he who comes to recall Adam!

\subheader{Magnification}
We magnify Thee, \\
O Christ, Giver of Life, \\
and we sing to thee, \\
Hosanna in the highest. \\
Blessed is He that cometh \\
in the name of the Lord.
