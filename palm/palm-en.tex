By raising Lazarus from the dead before \\
        \cont Thy passion, \\
Thou didst confirm the universal resurrection, \\
        \cont O Christ God! \\
Like the children with the branches of victory, \\
we cry out to Thee, O Vanquisher of Death: \\
Hosanna in the highest! \\
Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord!

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 6}
Sitting on Thy throne in heaven, \\
and carried on a foal on earth, O Christ God, \\
accept the praise of angels \\
and the songs of children who sing: \\
Blessed is he who comes to recall Adam!

\subheader{Magnification}
We magnify Thee, \\
O Christ the Giver of Life: \\
Hosanna in the highest! \\
And we cry aloud to Thee: \\
Blessed is He who cometh \\
in the name of the Lord.
