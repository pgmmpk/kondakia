O Christ God, You have ascended in Glory, \\
Granting joy to Your disciples by the promise \\
    \cont of the Holy Spirit. \\
Through the blessing they were assured \\
That You are the Son of God, \\
The Redeemer of the world!

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 6}
When You had fulfilled the dispensation \\
    \cont for our sake,\\
and united earth to heaven:\\
You ascended in glory, O Christ our God, \\
not being parted from those who love You, \\
but remaining with them and crying: \\
“I am with you and no one will be against you!”

\subheader{Magnification}
We magnify thee, \\
O Christ, Giver of Life, \\
and we venerate Thy divine Ascension \\
with Thy most pure flesh \\
into heaven.
