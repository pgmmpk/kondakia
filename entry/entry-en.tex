\subheader{Troparion, tone 4}
Today is the prelude of God's goodwill \\
and the heralding of salvation of mankind. \\
In the temple of God, the Virgin is presented openly, \\
and she proclaims Christ unto all. \\
To her, then, with a great voice let us cry aloud:\\
Rejoice, O thou fulfillment\\
of the Creator's dispensation.

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 4}
The most pure temple of the Saviour,\\
the most precious bridal-chamber and Virgin,\\
the sacred treasury of the glory of God,\\
is on this day brought into the house of the Lord,\\
bringing with her the grace that is in the Divine Spirit.\\
And the angels of God chant praise unto her:\\
she is the heavenly tabernacle.

\subheader{Magnification}
\vskip-0.5em
We magnify Thee,\\
O most holy Virgin, \\
God-chosen Maiden, \\
and we honor Thine entry \\
into the temple of the Lord.
