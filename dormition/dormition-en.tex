\subheader{Troparion, tone 1}
In giving birth thou didst preserve thy virginity; \\
in thy dormition thou didst not forsake the world, \\
    \cont O Theotokos. \\
Thou wast translated unto life, \\
since thou art the Mother of Life; \\
and by thine intercessions dost thou deliver \\
    \cont our souls from death.


\subheader{Kontakion, tone 8}
On the mount Thou wast transfigured, \\
and Thy disciples, as much as they could bear, \\
   \cont beheld Thy glory, O Christ God;\\
so that when they should see Thee crucified, \\
they would know Thy passion to be willing,\\
and would preach to the world\\
that Thou, in truth, art the Effulgence of the Father.

\subheader{Magnification}
\vskip -0.5em
We magnify You, \\
most pure Mother of Christ out God, \\
and we praise your \\
all-glorious Dormition
