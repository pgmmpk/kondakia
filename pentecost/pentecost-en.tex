Blessed art Thou, O Christ our God, \\
Who hast shown forth the fishermen \\
    \cont as supremely wise, \\
by sending down upon them the Holy Spirit, \\
and through them didst draw the \\
    \cont world into Thy net. \\
O Lover of mankind, glory be to Thee.

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 8}
Once, when He descended and \\
   \cont confounded the tongues, \\
the Most High divided the nations, \\
and when He divided the tongues of fire, \\
He called all men into unity, \\
and with one accord we glorify the All-holy Spirit.

\subheader{Magnification}
We magnify Thee, \\
O Life-giver Christ, \\
And we honor Thy most Holy Spirit, \\
Whom Thou didst send from the Father\\
unto Thy disciples.
