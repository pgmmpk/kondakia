Your Nativity, O Christ our God,\\
Has shone to the world the Light of wisdom!\\
For by it, those who worshipped the stars,\\
Were taught by a Star to adore You,\\
The Sun of Righteousness,\\
And to know You, the Orient from on High.\\
O Lord, glory to You!

Today the Virgin gives birth to the \\
   \cont Transcendent One,\\
And the earth offers a cave to the \\
    \cont Unapproachable One!\\
Angels with shepherds glorify Him!\\
The wise men journey with a star!\\
Since for our sake the Eternal God was born\\
as a Little Child!

\subheader{Magnification}

We magnify Thee, \\
O Lifegiver Christ, \\
who for our sake is now born in the flesh\\
from the unwedded\\
and immaculate Virgin Mary.
