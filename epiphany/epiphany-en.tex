When Thou, O Lord, wast baptized in the Jordan \\
the worship of the Trinity was made manifest! \\
For the voice of the Father bare witness to Thee,\\
calling Thee his Beloved Son.\\
And the Spirit, in the form of a dove,\\
confirmed the truthfulness of his Word. \\
O Christ our God, who hast revealed Thyself\\
and hast enlightened the world, glory to Thee

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 4}
Today Thou hast appeared to the universe,\\
and Thy Light, O Lord, has shone on us,\\
who with understanding praise Thee: \\
Thou hast come and revealed Thyself,\\
O Light Unapproachable!

\subheader{Magnification}
We magnify thee,\\
O Christ, Giver of Life, \\
who for our sake now art baptized in the flesh\\
by John\\
in the waters of the Jordan.
