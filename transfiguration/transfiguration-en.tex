Thou wast transfigured on the mountain, \\
   \cont O Christ our God, \\
showing to Thy disciples Thy glory as \\
    \cont each one could endudre; \\
shine forth Thou on us, who are sinners all, \\
    \cont Thy light ever-unending\\
through the prayers of the Theotokos, \\
    \cont O Light-giver, glory to Thee.

\subheader{Kontakion, tone 8}
On the mount Thou wast transfigured, \\
and Thy disciples, as much as they could bear, \\
   \cont beheld Thy glory, O Christ God;\\
so that when they should see Thee crucified, \\
they would know Thy passion to be willing,\\
and would preach to the world\\
that Thou, in truth, art the Effulgence of the Father.

\subheader{Magnification}
\vskip -0.5em
We magnify Thee, \\
O Life-Giving Christ, \\
and we do homage to the exceedingly glorious \\
Transfiguration of thy Body most pure.
