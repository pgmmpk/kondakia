Thy nativity, O Theotokos Virgin, /
hath proclaimed joy to all the world; /
for from thee hath dawned the Sun of Righteousness, Christ our God, /
annulling the curse, and bestowing the blessing, /
abolishing death and granting us life eternal.


\subheader{Kontakion, tone 4}

Joachim and Anna were freed from the reproach of childlessness /
and Adam and Eve from the corruption of death, by thy holy nativity, O immaculate one, /
which thy people, redeemed from the guilt of offenses, /
celebrate, by crying to thee: /
The barren woman giveth birth to the Theotokos, the nourisher of our life.

\subheader{Magnification}
%
We magnify thee, /
O Most-holy Virgin, /
and we honor thy holy parents /
and we glorify /
thine all-glorious nativity.
